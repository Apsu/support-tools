Support Tools
-------------

These are some simple support tools for installing and upgrading
OpenStack clusters.  Things in this directory:

 * chef-install
 Utilities for installing a chef server with the rcbops cookbooks, as
 well as installing and registering chef clients

 * vmdk-conversion
 Utilities for vmdk conversion.  Currently converts vmdk -> qcow2, and
 in the future may do driver injection for windows hosts.
